# # Ford GoBike System User Analysis
## by Brent Murphy

## Dataset

> This investigation of the Ford GoBike System will examine the users of the rideshare system and their riding characteristics Specifically when do users ride and is there a difference between the riders habits. 

> This dataset consists of 3,017,675 records gathered from Amazon AWS from 2017 to April of 2019. This data comes from the Ford GoBike bike rideshare system covering the San Francisco and San Jose area. The bikes are available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year and riders have access to all bikes in the network when they become a member or purchase a pass, these users are known as subscribers. The bikes can also be rented with out a subscription and those users are known as customers. This analysis will show who makes up the subscribers and customers and how they utilize the bikes in the system.

### Due to the large size of the data that I downloaded I have excluded the "uncleaned" file from the included files but they can be found on my PC and can be sent if needed.

## Summary of Findings

> I found that gender makeup does not change signifigantly between subscribers and customers. Monday thru Friday between 7-9 AM and 4-6 PM in months that typically have a more temperate climate are the busiest times for the bikeshare for both subscribers and customers. Customers, however, use the bikes more on the weekends throughout the day. Customers also tend to use the bike for a longer time and go longer distances.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The heatmap showing the hourly usage during the weekday for customers and subscribers really shows the difference between the usage between the two user groups. The heatmap showing the hourly usage during the weekday for males and females was also insightful, showing very little difference in usage by the 2 groups.
